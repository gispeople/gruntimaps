These controls have been developed for use with mapbox-gl-js. 

Zoom-Level-Control displays the current map zoom level. It can be useful when trying to decide on filtering based on the zoom level.

Info-Control displays the attributes of the object currently under the mouse. It's intended mainly for use when looking for useful attributes to add to the rendered layers.

Scale-Control combines the metric and imperial scales from MapBox into a single control.

Tilt-Control provides a simple button to switch between a 2D and 3D map.
