These controls have been developed for use with mapbox-gl-js. 

Zoom-Level=Control displays the current map zoom level. It can be useful when trying to decide on filtering based on the zoom level.

Info-Control displays the attributes of the object currently under the mouse. It's intended mainly for use when looking for useful attributes to add to the rendered layers.
