These SVG icons can be processed using spritezero to create fill-patterns for use in maps.

It's remarkable that there doesn't appear to be a lot of them around because without them you can't really do pattern fills. 

Hopefully this will be the start of a useful collection of fill patterns. At this stage, it's just some left and right 45 degree hatches in a variety of colours.

Our sprite sets as served by gruntimaps include these sprites already.
